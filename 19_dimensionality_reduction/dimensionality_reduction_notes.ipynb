    "* Specifically, it models each high-dimensional object by a two- or three-dimensional point in such a way that similar objects are modeled by nearby points and dissimilar objects are modeled by distant points\n",

    "* t-SNE algorithm:\n",
    "    * Given a set of $N$ high-dimensional objects $x_1,\\dots,x_N$, t-SNE first computes probabilities $p_{ij}$ that are proportional to the similarity of the objects $x_i$ and $x_j$: $$p_{j\\mid i} = \\frac{e^{\\big(\\frac{-\\Vert x_i - x_j \\Vert^2}{2\\sigma^2_i}\\big)}}{\\sum_{k \\neq i}e^{\\big(\\frac{-\\Vert x_i - x_k \\Vert^2}{2\\sigma^2_i}\\big)}}$$\n",

    "    * t-SNE aims to learn a $d$-dimensional map $y_1,\\dots,y_N$ (with $y_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ that reflects the similarities $p_{ij}$ as well as possible.\n",
    "        * To this end, it measure similarities $q_{ij}$ between two points in the map $y_i$ and $y_j$, using very similar approach: $$q_{ij} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{1+\\Vert y_i-y_j \\Vert^2}}{\\sum_{k \\neq i} \\frac{1}{1+\\Vert y_i-y_k \\Vert^2}}$$\n",
